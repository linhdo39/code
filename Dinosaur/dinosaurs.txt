T-rex#a bipedal carnivore with a massive skull balanced by a long, heavy tail. Relative to its large and powerful hind limbs, Tyrannosaurus forelimbs were short but unusually powerful for their size and had two clawed digits. #12#40#Western North America#1#0#1000#700#0#Archaeopteryx#It was a bird-like dinosaur that is transitional between non-avian feathered dinosaurs and modern birds. Archaeopteryx was roughly the size of a raven, with broad wings that were rounded at the ends and a long tail compared to its body length.#1.5#0.7#Bavaria, Germany#0#20#100#200#500#Brachiosaurus#A member of the Sauropoda. It had a quadruped with a small skull, a long neck, a large trunk with a high-ellipsoid cross section, a long, muscular tail and slender, columnar limbs. Large air sacs connected to the lung system were present in the neck and trunk, invading the vertebrae and ribs by bone resorption, greatly reducing the overall density of the body. The overall build of Brachiosaurus resembles a giraffe more than any other living animal.#65#35#North America#0#50#40#300#100#Velociraptor#Had a large manus ('hand') with three strongly curved claws, which were similar in construction and flexibility to the wing bones of modern birds. There had been studied to confirm the presence of feather in Velociraptor. It had 26-28 widely spaced teeth on each side, each more strongly serrated on the back edge than the front.#6.8#1.6#Mongolia#1#10#45#150#500#Therizinosaurus#It had the longest known claws from any animal. The claws were relatively straight, only gradually tapering into a point, as well as extremely narrow and transversely flattened. The feeding habits of Therizinosaurus are unknown since no skull material has ever been found that could indicate their diet. However, they were most likely herbivorous based on the classification. #33#10#Mongolia#0#10#20#700#500#Irritator#Irritator's skull was long, narrow, and somewhat triangular in cross section. The braincase was inclined backwards, and deeper than it was long.A thin sagittal crest, constructed from the elongate nasal bones, ran up the skull midline before stopping just above the eye in a slightly flattened bulge. Although the complete shape and height of this structure is unknown in Irritator, these head crests were commonplace in spinosaurids, having possibly served a display function when the animal was alive. Irritator had straight or only faintly recurved conical teeth, bearing sharply defined but unserrated edges.#20#7#South America#1#20#30#400#900#
